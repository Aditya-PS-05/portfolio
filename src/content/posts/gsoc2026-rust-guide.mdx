## Introduction

Getting into Google Summer of Code (GSoC) with a Rust project is an excellent way to contribute to open source while learning from experienced mentors.

## Finding Rust Projects

Look for organizations that use Rust:

- **Rust Language** - The compiler and standard library
- **Servo** - Mozilla's parallel browser engine
- **TiKV** - Distributed transactional key-value database

## Tips for Success

1. Start contributing early
2. Understand the codebase before proposing
3. Communicate with mentors
4. Write clean, documented code
