## What is Mechanistic Interpretability?

Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) is a subfield of AI alignment and machine learning research focused on understanding **how** neural networks work internally—not just what they do, but the specific algorithms and representations they learn.

Unlike traditional interpretability methods (like saliency maps or feature importance), MI aims to reverse-engineer the actual computations happening inside models, much like understanding a circuit diagram rather than just observing inputs and outputs.

## Why Does It Matter?

As AI systems become more powerful and are deployed in critical applications, we need to:

1. **Verify alignment** - Ensure models are pursuing intended objectives
2. **Detect deception** - Identify if models are behaving differently during evaluation vs. deployment
3. **Predict failures** - Understand edge cases before they occur
4. **Build trust** - Provide genuine explanations for model behavior

## Key Concepts

### Superposition
Models represent more features than they have dimensions by encoding features in overlapping, almost-orthogonal directions. This makes interpretation challenging but is key to understanding model capacity.

### Circuits
Specific computational subgraphs within neural networks that implement identifiable algorithms (e.g., induction heads in transformers that enable in-context learning).

### Features
The fundamental units of representation that models learn—often corresponding to human-interpretable concepts like "is a proper noun" or "refers to a location."
